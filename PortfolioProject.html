 <p>Now, this is my most proudest and most recent project in this class (as of making this at least). This was an improved version of the first ever project we did in class. However, my first project is lost in the void (or maybe in a different account) so I wasn't able to find it. But hey! This looks so much more prettier, doesn't it? I was very proud to apply all that I learned into this.</p>
