  <p>This project was our introduction to useing CSS. CSS was a very difficult language for me to use because of how <b>complicated</b> the different designs could be. When we got to layout, I struggled even more. Regardless, I was very proud of how this turned out! I used a well known poem from the game Minecraft as my poem.</p>
