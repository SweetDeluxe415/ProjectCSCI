  <p>This project was out introduction to using Javascript, a proper way to have our websites be interactable! I enjoyed making a madlibs game with the program. I took forever deciding how to write the story though as I wanted it to make sense as much as possible with all the words that could be chosen. I think the story ended up going nicely! Though, I have more to improve on.</p>
