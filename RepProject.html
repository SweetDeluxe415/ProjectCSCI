  <p>This project was our introduction to arrays, aka what makes life easier. After doing the quiz projects with <b>SO. MANY. IF. STATEMENTS</b>, I couldn't help but wonder if there was any easier way to do this. Turns out there is! With good old arrasys, I was able to just fill in the blanks and have everything else repeat. Though, the way I made this project, there was little to repeat. Around this time, Transformers One just came out and my significant other and I watched it. It still has not left our minds.</p>
